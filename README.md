# MY TEAM GENERATOR

## Description 

This is a back-end projected developed with node.js to create a site listing all of the employees in a Manager's team and their general contact and GitHub information. This application uses the command line in the user's Terminal to create a html web page by asking a variety of questions pertaining to the employees positions. These questions are prompted using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and created with [Inquirer Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) was used to test the code before the application was created. Once the user is finished inputing all of their staff information a html file is created containing a card for each employee. 

A manager is able to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic information so that they have access to their emails and GitHub profiles. The manager is able to just answer a few questions and then an entire html page with all that information is created. Each specific job role is color coded so it makes finding the correct employee easier.
